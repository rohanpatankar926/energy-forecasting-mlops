# ETL Pipeline

This repository contains the files for an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline.

## File Structure

The directory structure is as follows:

- `pipeline_main.py`: The main script that executes the ETL pipeline.
- `etl/` (directory):
  - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the `etl` directory as a Python package.
  <!-- - `data_load.py`: Contains functions for loading data into the pipeline. -->
  - `data_ingestion.py`: Contains functions for ingesting data from a source.
  <!-- - `data_validation.py`: Includes functions for validating the loaded data. -->
  - `data_transformation.py`: Includes functions for transforming the ingested data.

## Usage

To execute the ETL pipeline, run the `pipeline_main.py` script. Ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed and properly configured before running the script.

Modify the various files within the `etl/` directory as per your specific data extraction, transformation, and loading requirements.

## Dependencies

List any external dependencies or libraries required to run the ETL pipeline. Include installation instructions if necessary.
